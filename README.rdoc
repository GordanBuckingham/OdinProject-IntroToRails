This is a simple blog website I created to start learning Rails. The project is part of the Odin Project tutorial: http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/ruby-on-rails

This particular project is from Jumpstart Lab: http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html

This is a basic blog site which features:
	- basic authentication / authors
	- tags
	- comments
